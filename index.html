           <h2>World-class professional Web Developer</h2>
           <p>I'm a web developer. My primary role is to create and maintain websites and web applications. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual parts of a website (the front-end), which users interact with. I also work with server-side logic and databases (the back-end) to ensure the website functions smoothly. My goal is to create a user-friendly, attractive, and effective online experience. I'm skilled at problem-solving and eager to learn new technologies.</p>
